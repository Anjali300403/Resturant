# Resturant
This is a sample project to display my html and css knowledge over the course of one month. The name and logo of the restaurant have also been designed by me and I'm glad I got to revise concepts and brainstorm a little to make this website. This is my first complete html+css project and I'll try to update it with functionality(js) very soon.
