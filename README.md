# Resturant
This is a sample project to display my html and css knowledge over the course of one month. The name and logo of the restaurant have also been designed by me and I'm glad I got to revise concepts and brainstorm a little to make this website. This is my first complete html+css project and I'll try to update it with functionality(js) very soon. 
While I did sit down to make this project on my own, a lot of the design layout and concepts are from the course "html,css and js for web development" which I'm currently studying on coursera. However, the coding does reflect my understanding of the course and its first three modules.
