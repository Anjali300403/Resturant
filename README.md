# Resturant
This is a sample project to display my html and css knowledge over the course of one month. The name and logo of the restaurant have also been designed by me and I'm glad I got to revise concepts and brainstorm a little to make this website. This is my first complete html+css project and I'll try to update it with functionality(js) very soon. 
While I did sit down to make this project on my own, a lot of the design layout and concepts are from the course "html,css and js for web development" which I'm currently studying on coursera. However, the coding does reflect my understanding of the course and its first three modules.
I'd also like to point out that I used chatgpt to regenerate codes ( I wrote the initial code ) for different food items(instead of having to repeat it 10-12 times on my own) and descriptions to save time. In simple words, I wrote the code for getting the menu of the food category pizza and then ran that code on chat gpt instructing it to only change pizza details with the detail of the concerned food category. Information like about us,resturant review are all fictional and generated via chatgpt. However, the primary coding has been done by me. 
The website should work perfectly for a laptop/tab. However, the layout may not be suitable for a phone ( as I haven't focused a lot on the media queries. However, I will try to improve the layout in my upcoming projects. 
Note: Clicking on the logo or name of the resturant on the header redirects you to the main page. 

THANK YOU
